# GoogleFormPrepopulator
A simple JS bookmark that allows creating a pre-populated Google Form.

To use:  
1. (one time) Create a bookmark with the contents of `form.js`.
2. Open the form you'd like to prepopulate and manually edit the fields. Once the form is at the state you'd like, move on to the next stage.
3. Click the bookmark. If all goes well, a new tab should open with a prepopulated form.

<strong>Note: </strong>this was only tested on Chrome with a simple form. Feel free to send fixes.
